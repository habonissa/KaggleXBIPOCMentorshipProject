The goal is to measure bias in Twitter's automatic saliency-based image cropping algorithm by forcing the algorithm to choose between two individuals of different gender, racial and/or ethnic backgrounds thousands of times. This will allow us to determine what preferences the algorithm has. Specifically, this notebook:\n","\n","1. Creates thousands of ordered pairs by adding two images (of individuals who self identify as different races/genders/ethnicities) to opposite ends of a plain white grid with the GenerateOrderedPairs function.\n","\n","2. Determines which of the two images in each generated ordered pair is the more salient image according to Twitter's algorithm (ie the image that would be preserved after Twitter's automatic cropping policy is enacted), then stores that information to compute a survival ratio that quantifies Twitter's racial/ethnic/gender preferences in the function GetSurvivalRatio\n","\n","3. Saves survival ratios to a separate file for further analysis with function CompareSurvivalRatio\n","\n","4. Visualizes survival ratio data\n","\n","5. Optional: allows for visualization of exact crop of most salient image within the GetSurvivalRaito function\n","\n","\n","Groups that make up ordered pairs with individual images from Chicago Face Database:\n","1. 'WF' White Female\n","2. 'WM' White Male\n","5. 'BF' Black Female\n","6. 'BM' Black Male\n","7. 'IF' Indian Female\n","8. 'IM' Indian Male\n","The above groups are also abbreviations used for functions since they reference real strings within CFD image
